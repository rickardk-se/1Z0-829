# Operations and Core Data Types

## Exam objectives covered

**Handling date, time, text, numeric and boolean values**

* Use primitives and wrapper classes including Math API, parentheses, type promotion, and casting to evaluate arithmetic and boolean expressions
* Manipulate text, including text blocks, using String and StringBuilder classes
* Manipulate date, time, duration, period, instant and time-zone objects using Date-Time API

## Java Operators

| Operator Type       | Syntax                                             |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Postfix             | `++` `--`                                          |
| Prefix / Unary      | `++` `--`  `+` `-` `!` `~`                         |
| Multiplicative      | `*` `/` `%`                                        |
| Additive            | `+` `-`                                            |
| Shift               | `<<` `>>` `>>>`                                    |
| Relational          | `<` `>` `<=` `>=` `instanceof`                     |
| Equality            | `==` `!=`                                          |
| Bitwise AND         | `&`                                                |
| Bitwise exclusive OR| `^`                                                |
| Bitwise inclusive OR| `\|`                                               |
| Logical AND         | `&&`                                               |
| Logical OR          | `\|\|`                                             |
| Conditional         | `? :`                                              |
| Assignment          | `=` `+=` `-=` `*=` `/=` `%=` `&=` `^=` `\|=` `<<=` `>>=` `>>>=`|

The precedence of the bitwise and logical operators are from top of the table & (AND) to bottom || (Logical OR).


* Expressions (2 + 3)
* L-values (left side of an assignment)
    * Assignable
    * `array[3]`
    * Variables
* Side effects
    * `++i`
    * Alter L-values

In Java, an L-value (short for "left value") is an expression that refers to a memory location and can appear either on the left side or the right side of an assignment operator. The name "L-value" comes from its ability to appear on the left side of an assignment, but this does not restrict it from appearing on the right side as well.

### Operand evaluation
* Left to right
* Before performing operation

In an expression, operands are the data items that an operator acts upon. For instance, in the arithmetic expression 5 * 7, 5 and 7 are the operands, and * is the operator.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 5;
        int y = 10;
        int result = multiplyAndPrint(x++, y++);
        System.out.println("After operation, x = " + x + ", y = " + y);
    }

    private static int multiplyAndPrint(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("In the method, a = " + a + ", b = " + b);
        return a * b;
    }
}

```

Running above code results in the following output.

```java
In the method, a = 5, b = 10
After operation, x = 6, y = 11
```
